5. Click display
6. Select CT NIfTI
7. Move crosshair to estimated Talairach origin
8. Write down crosshair position in mm (right, forward, up)
9. Figure out the values by which you would have to adjust the CT crosshair position to match the MRI crosshair position (to within a few mm).
10. Enter these values into the boxes labeled "right", "forward", and "up".
11. Hit return
12. Click reorient images
